//! Powerful schema migration builder API in Rust.
//!
//! Barrel is meant to make writing migrations for different databases as easy
//! as possible. It has three primary models:
//! the [Migration](migration/struct.Migration.html) which represents
//! all changes and changes made on a database level,
//! the [Table](table/struct.Table.html) and the
//! [Column](column/struct.Column.html).
//!
//! When creating or altering tables a lambda which exposes `&mut Table` is
//! provided for initialisation. Adding columns is then as easy as calling
//! `add_column(...)` on the table.
//!
//! Each column is statically typed and some types require some metadata in order
//! to compile the migration (for example `Varchar(255)`). You can also provide
//! default types and override encodings, nullability or uniqueness of columns.
//! Some checks are performed at compile-time however most things (including)
//! correct default values) are only checked at runtime.
//!
//! **Note** Since version `0.3.0` it is required to provide a database backend
//! in order to compile `barrel`.
//!
//! The following code is a simple example of how to get going with `barrel`
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate barrel;
//!
//! use barrel::{Migration, Type};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut m = Migration::new();
//!     m.create_table("users", |t| {
//!         t.add_column("name", Type::Varchar(255));
//!         t.add_column("age", Type::Integer);
//!         t.add_column("owns_plushy_sharks", Type::Boolean);
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
//! `barrel` also supports more advanced types, such as `Foreign(...)`
//! and `Array(...)` however currently doesn't support nested Array types on
//! foreign keys (such as `Array(Array(Foreign(...)))`). Each column addition
//! returns a Column object which can then be used to provide further
//! configuration.
//!
//! To generate SQL strings you have two options. If you just want to run the
//! migration yourself simply run `Migration::exec()` where you provide a
//! generic `SqlGenerator` type according to your database backend
//!
//! ```norun
//! // Example for pgsql
//! m.make::<Pg>();
//! ```
//!
//! Alternatively, if you're a library developer and you want to more easily
//! embed `barrel` into your library you can simply implement the
//! `DatabaseExecutor` trait for a type of yours that knows how to execute SQL.
//! Running a migration with `barrel` is then super easy.
//!
//! ```norun
//! m.execute(executor);
//! ```
//!
//! In this case `executor` is your provided type which implements the required
//! trait. You can read more about this in the `connectors` module docs.
//!
//! **Important**: This crate is still early in development and the API might
//! change rapidely between pre-release versions. I will try as best I can to
//! include changes in the `CHANGELOG` but can not guarantee perfect coverage.
//!
//! Also, if there is missing or invalid documentation for this crate, PR's are
//! always welcome ðŸ’š
